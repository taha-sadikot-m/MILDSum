IN THE HIGH COURT OF JAMMU AND KASHMIR

Case No: WP(C) 456/2022
Date: 15th March 2023

M/s XYZ Industries vs State of Jammu & Kashmir

JUDGMENT

The petitioner company has filed this writ petition seeking quashment of the 
government order dated 28.12.2015 which withdrew permission for changing 
arc furnace to induction furnace.

FACTS:

The petitioner is a company incorporated under the Companies Act running a 
casting unit at Bari Brahmana, Jammu. It manufactures M.S Ingots and allied 
products. The petitioner was sanctioned power load of 2250 KVA for manufacture 
of Ferro Alloys vide Government Order dated 18.10.1995.

From 2007-08, the working of the unit became erratic due to non-availability 
of chromite ore from Orissa. The petitioner approached the Power Development 
Department seeking permission to replace the existing arc furnace with induction 
furnace as it is more environment friendly and less burdening on the power 
supply system.

LEGAL ISSUES:

1. Whether the government order imposing ban on new power connections can be 
   applied retrospectively to existing connections?

2. Whether changing from arc furnace to induction furnace amounts to seeking 
   fresh power connection?

ARGUMENTS:

The petitioner argued that it never applied for fresh power connection as the 
power connection was already sanctioned in 1995. The case was only for seeking 
permission for change of machinery.

The respondent argued that the order of ban covers all cases including change 
of activity from arc furnace to induction furnace.

REASONING:

The court observed that though the power connection was granted in 1995, once 
a subsequent government order specifically provides that it supersedes all 
previous orders, the earlier connection loses its significance.

The court held that shifting from arc furnace to electric induction furnace 
would amount to granting fresh power connection which conflicts with the ban 
imposed vide government order dated 03.03.2010.

CONCLUSION:

The petition is dismissed. The court found that retrospective operation of a 
government order cannot be permitted particularly where it is merely an 
executive order and not legislation.

The petitioner cannot question the order after accepting it for 12 years and 
is estopped under law to question the same at such belated stage.

ORDER:

The writ petition is dismissed. No costs.
